Vim Color Scheme Test Ruby
==========================

Why
----

The original script by maverick.woo ( https://code.google.com/p/vimcolorschemetest/ ) is written in Perl and the build works on Windows
systems. I wanted to add some new features, but as I'm not very confident with Perl I preferred to start over with a new Ruby version
instead of forking his project.

What it does
----

The script loads all your colorschemes from your default vim directory (~/.vim/colors), and writes into the output dir an HTML file for
each colorscheme, with a render of a Ruby file using this colorscheme.

What it needs to run
----

* ruby
* macvim
